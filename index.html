            <b>OpenUpLearning</b> : A platform for curious learners with focus on providing credible resources, collaborative environment and community of experts.
            <p style="display: none;">For a curious learner, Having good credible resources, collaborative environment and experts to talk to is a perfect symphony. 
            I never experienced that symphony myself, but I see it's very important for a learners to have this symphony in their learning journey.
            At OpenUpLearning I am trying to create such a place where a curious learner will have good credible resources curated by community, 
            a collaborative environment with those who share common interest, and a community of experts who can answer you silly doubts about life and learning. 
            Mission is to make learning as fun and collaborative as possible.</p>
